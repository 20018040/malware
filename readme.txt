2. This offset now contains

3. My experience with the project was that I need to get myself familiar with more opcodes and machine language because it
took me a lot of time to understand those hexa codes. It was also first time actually looking at professional (even though its old)
so it was exciting but overwhelming at the same time. Honestly, I do have some fear if I would be able to work in the field once
I graduate when I looked at the code. And it was my first time debugging someone elses work so I learned a lot from it. Although 
the back ground musics started to annoy me at a point, I enjoyed the assignment because it was challening and different than other 
classes. Thank you professor.
